# science-gothic-fixed
Weights generated from Science Gothic Variable font (https://github.com/googlefonts/science-gothic) with fixed glyphs.
Generated using (https://fontgauntlet.com).

The default static font from Science Gothic repo may be broken on some systems (like "w" glyph not changing weight, broken numbers, etc) so I decided to generate a set of static fonts from a variable font from (https://github.com/googlefonts/science-gothic).
